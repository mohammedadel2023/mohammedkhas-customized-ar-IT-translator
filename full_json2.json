This results in the network becoming unusable.\nSTP is a loop-prevention network protocol that allows for redundancy while creating a loop-free Layer 2 topology. Without STP, Layer 2 loops can form, causing broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast frames to loop endlessly, bringing down a network.\nUsing the STA, STP builds a loop-free topology in a four-step process: elect the root bridge, elect the root ports, elect designated ports, and elect alternate (blocked) ports.\nDuring STA and STP functions, switches use BPDUs to share information about themselves and their connections. BPDUs are used to elect the root bridge, root ports, designated ports, and alternate ports.\nWhen the root bridge has been elected for a given spanning tree instance, the STA determines the best paths to the root bridge from all destinations in the broadcast domain. The path information, known as the internal root path cost, is determined by the sum of all the individual port costs along the path from the switch to the root bridge.\nAfter the root bridge has been determined the STA algorithm selects the root port. The root port is the port closest to the root bridge in terms of overall cost, which is called the internal root path cost.\nAfter each switch selects a root port, switches will select designated ports. The designated port is a port on the segment (with two switches) that has the internal root path cost to the root bridge.\nIf a port is not a root port or a designated port, then it becomes an alternate (or backup) port.

When an ACL is applied to an interface, the router performs the additional task of evaluating all network packets as they pass through the interface to determine if the packet can be forwarded.\nAn ACL uses a sequential list of permit or deny statements, known as access control entries (ACEs).\nNote: ACEs are also commonly called ACL statements.\nWhen network traffic passes through an interface configured with an ACL, the router compares the information within the packet against each ACE, in sequential order, to determine if the packet matches one of the ACEs.
